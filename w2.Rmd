In this session I'll teach you about the grammar of graphics and get you going with ggplot2.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("img/wk02-plots.png")
```

## Weekly Post-Session Challenge

This week's challenge is to make a lollipop chart instead of the bar chart. You need two geoms: `geom_point()` and `geom_segment()`. Points give you the yummy candy, and segments are the sticks. Google "ggplot lollipop chart" to get started and post your questions and progress to Piazza.
