In this session I'll introduce you to R and RStudio. We'll make our first plot, and I'll demonstrate how you can share this plot in a reproducible workflow.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("img/wk01-plots.png")
```

## Weekly Post-Session Challenge

1. In the comments of the Rmd file there's a link to the NY Times Github repository. Go there and find the url to the raw CSV file for county-level data. Replace the url in the markdown file to grab county-level rather than state-level data. You can rename the objects if you wish ("st" refers to state in my naming scheme, so maybe use "co" if you make a change).

2. Limit the data to the top 5 worst affected counties from 1 state in terms of deaths.

3. Update the plot.
