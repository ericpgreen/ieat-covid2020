In this session I'll teach you how to get data into R and how to wrangle it until it does what you want.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("img/wk03-plots.png")
```

## Weekly Post-Session Challenge

In this session we plotted country-level case data from JHU's global file. For this challenge I want you to [get US state-level data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series) and plot daily confirmed case counts for the top 20 US states in terms of total case count by the end of the time series. I also want you to experiment with the plot look and feel. Come up with a new color scheme by replacing the hex codes (#ffffff) with [colors of your choice](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/).
