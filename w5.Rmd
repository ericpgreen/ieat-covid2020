In this session I'll show you just how easy it is to create interactive and animated plots in R (thanks to the hard work from folks behind a few key packages).

## Inspiration

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("img/wk05-inspiration.gif")
```

## Goal

## Weekly Post-Session Challenge

This week's challenge is to use `{gganimate}` to animate our Week 1 line plot. Start by watching this 20-min [this rstudio::conf 2019 talk](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2019/gganimate-live-cookbook/) by Thomas Lin Pederson on `{gganimate}`.
