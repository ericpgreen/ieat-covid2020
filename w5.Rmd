In this session I'll show you just how easy it is to create interactive and animated plots in R (thanks to the hard work from folks behind a few key packages).

## Inspiration

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("img/wk05-inspiration.gif")
```

## Goal

<video width="1000" height="600" controls>
  <source src="img/gganim.mp4" type="video/mp4">
