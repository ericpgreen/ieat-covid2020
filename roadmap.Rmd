Here's our schedule. I'm making all of this up as I go along, so the order and content might change from week to week. I'm drawing inspiration from a 2017 version of this workshop developed with Dr. Amy Finnegan (IntraHealth) and from loads of great online learning materials, such as Grolemund and Wickham's [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). My goal is to give you a glimpse of what you can do in R and to give you enough skills to know how to take the next step in your learning after the workshop.  

1. Getting started with R and RStudio
2. Getting to know `{ggplot2}`
3. Importing and transforming data
4. Exploratory data analysis
5. Interactive and animated plots
6. Relational data
7. Text mining
8. Flexdashboards (and shiny apps)
9. Tidymodels
10. Reproducible workflows
