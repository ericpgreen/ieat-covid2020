# This week's inspiration

This week's inspiration comes from a pre-print by @hauser:2020 that estimates SARS-CoV-2 mortality in two of the hardest hit regions early in the pandemic: Hubei province, China and northern Italy.[^notpr] I took a screenshot of Figure 1 Panel B from their manuscript.

[^notpr]: This is a footnote to say that pre-prints like this one have not been peer reviewed.

```{r inspiration, fig.cap="Figure 1 B from @hauser:2020.", out.height='40%', fig.align='center'}
  knitr::include_graphics('img/jriou.png')
```

Inserting external images like this one is easy in RMarkdown. There are a few ways, but I recommend creating a code chunk and calling `include_graphics()` from the `{knitr}` package. Note that I added a figure caption and specified that I wanted to limit the height of the image. For some reason my reference is not formatting properly in the citation, but let's not worry about that now.

# Get the data

There's a lot going on in this paper, so I grabbed just the bits we need to create this plot. Visit the authors' Github repository to access the full data and code to reproduce their entire manuscript [@riou:2020].

```{r}
# find "riou-covid-wide.csv" in the Files tab and note the path to the file
# replace ____ with the path to the file and the file name

# you can run getwd() to see the working directory
# but i'll save you a step: your working directory is "/cloud/project"
# so what is the full path to the file (including the file name)?

# this line will fail until you replace ____
  df <- read.csv("____", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Open `df_wide` in the Viewer by clicking on the object name in the Environment.

## Wide format

You're probably used to working with data in a 'wide' format like you see in Figure \@ref(fig:wide). If you were to recreate this figure in Excel, you'd probably create the facets one by one by highlighting the column with age categories and one of the value columns. 

```{r wide, fig.cap="Data in the wide format.", out.width='100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
# echo=FALSE prevents printing this code in our report
# when output is set to bookdown::pdf_document2, you can include cross-referenced tables and figures
# in \@ref(fig:wide), wide refers to the name of the chunk

  knitr::include_graphics('img/wide_excel.png')
```

## Long format

For most `{ggplot2}` operations, however, you'll need to transform the data to a long format. Run the following chunk and inspect the object you create called `df_long`.

```{r}
# we'll more talk about functions like pivot_longer() next week
# for now, just read this as a pipe that starts with the data, and then (%>%)..
# does something (renames variables with rename()), and then (%>%)...
# does something else (reshapes the data from wide to long with pivot_longer())

  df_long <- 
  df_wide %>%
    rename(`prop_Chinese population` = pop,
           `prop_Reported cases` = prop_cases_tmax,
           `prop_Reported deaths` = prop_mort_tmax) %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = -age_class,
                 names_to = "variable",
                 names_prefix = "prop_",
                 values_to = "value"
                )  

  df_long
```

## Tidy data

The result of `pivot_longer()` is a **tidy** dataframe. According to Hadley Wickham, RStudio's Chief Scientist and creator of many great packages like `{ggplot2}`, tidy data have three characteristics [@wickham:2014]:

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

This tidy format will make advanced plotting a breeze.

# `ggplot()` basics

`{ggplot2}` implements the Leland Wilkinson's "grammar of graphics" [@wilkinson:1999]. @layered-grammar describes the grammar of graphics as: 

> ...a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic. Such a grammar allows us to move beyond named graphics (e.g., the "scatterplot") and gain insight into the deep structure that underlies statistical graphics.

*Hit play on the chunk so you can see the image that will become Figure \@ref(fig:gg) when knitted.*

```{r gg, fig.cap="Source: Thomas Lin Pederson.", out.width='100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.pos='!ht'}
# echo=FALSE prevents printing this code in our report
# See Thomas's amazing workshop on ggplot2, https://github.com/thomasp85/ggplot2_workshop

  knitr::include_graphics('img/thomas_ggplot.png')
```

## Data

Every plot begins with data, but data alone do not make a plot as you can see in Figure \@ref(fig:blank).

```{r blank, fig.cap="Nothing to see here.", out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
  ggplot(df_long)
```

## Mapping/Aesthetics

The next step is to tell R how our data maps on to the plot with the `aes()` function. In our case, we want to plot proportions by age category. Let's filter the data to just the population data and forget for a moment that we're actually trying to create 3 panels.  

```{r, fig.show='hide'}
# fig.show='hide' will prevent the plot from printing to pdf

# here's an example of piping from the data to ggplot
# it's also an example of assigning the ggplot object 

  p <- 
  df_long %>%
    filter(variable=="Chinese population") %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x=age_class, y=value)) +
      labs(title = "",
           subtitle = "",
           caption = "",
           x = "",
           y = "")

# can print with p
  p
```

Ultimately we want age on the y-axis for display purposes, but we'll start with age on x.[^new]

[^new]: Starting in `{ggplot2}` 3.3.0 you no longer need to map to `x` and then flip the coordinates for some geoms: https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/03/ggplot2-3-3-0/. 

## Statistics

Sometimes you need to perform some calculation on the data prior to plotting, but my preference is to do this in a pipeline prior to piping to `ggplot()`. In this example our data have already been summarized by age category, so we do not need to add a statistics layer. This would have been necessary if we had raw counts by age instead of proportions. 

## Geometries

"geoms", or geometric objects, tell R what type of plot you want to make. [There are a bunch of options](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-layer-geoms).

```{r, fig.show='hide'}

# try adding geom_point(), run the chunk, remove and add geom_col()
  p + geom_col()
```

## Scales

Last week we changed the scale of our plot from linear to exponential. Today we need to convert proportions to percentages and fiddle with the limits and breaks. 

```{r, fig.show='hide'}
  p <- 
  p + 
    geom_col() + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent,
                       limits = c(0, .3),
                       breaks = c(seq(0, .3, .1)))
  
  p
```

## Facets

A common mistake is to cram too much into one plot. I submit to you Exhibit A.

```{r, fig.show='hide'}
  df_long %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x=age_class, y=value, fill=variable)) +
    geom_col(position = 'dodge') + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent,
                       breaks = c(seq(0, .3, .1))) +
    labs(title = "China's elderly are hardest hit by Covid-19",
           subtitle = "Age distribution of the Chinese population and of the\nreported Covid-19 cases and deaths in Hubei, China.",
           caption = "Data: Riou et al. (2020). https://github.com/jriou/covid_adjusted_cfr",
           x = "Age group",
           y = "") # I'm leaving blank because no axis title need
```
That sucks. You want small multiples. Facets.

```{r, fig.show='hide'}

  df_long %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x=age_class, y=value)) + 
    geom_col() + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent,
                       breaks = c(seq(0, .3, .1))) +
    labs(title = "China's elderly are hardest hit by Covid-19",
           subtitle = "Age distribution of the Chinese population and of the reported Covid-19 cases\nand deaths in Hubei, China.",
           caption = "Data: Riou et al. (2020). https://github.com/jriou/covid_adjusted_cfr",
           x = "Age group",
           y = "") +
  
  # here is the new piece
  # try setting scales to "fixed_y" then "free_y" (remember quotes)
    facet_wrap(~variable, scales = )
```
## Coordinates

Home stretch. Let's flip the plot so age group is on the y-axis.

```{r, fig.show='hide'}

  df_long %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x=age_class, y=value)) + 
    geom_col() + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent,
                       breaks = c(seq(0, .3, .1))) +
    labs(title = "China's elderly are hardest hit by Covid-19",
           subtitle = "Age distribution of the Chinese population and of the reported Covid-19 cases\nand deaths in Hubei, China.",
           caption = "Data: Riou et al. (2020). https://github.com/jriou/covid_adjusted_cfr",
           x = "", # some would argue removing this as well
           y = "") +
    facet_wrap(~variable) + # fixed is the default so we can leave it off
  
  # here is the new piece
    coord_flip()
```
## Themes

The `theme()` function can make a good plot a great plot. Often you can get 95% of the way to a solid plot if you use one of the built in themes. Just start typing the word 'theme' and RStudio will try and autocomplete.

```{r, fig.show='hide'}

  df_long %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x=age_class, y=value)) + 
    geom_col() + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent,
                       breaks = c(seq(0, .3, .1))) +
    labs(title = "China's elderly are hardest hit by Covid-19",
           subtitle = "Age distribution of the Chinese population and of the reported\nCovid-19 cases and deaths in Hubei, China.",
           caption = "Data: Riou et al. (2020). https://github.com/jriou/covid_adjusted_cfr",
           x = "", # some would argue removing this as well
           y = "") +
    facet_wrap(~variable) + 
    coord_flip() +
  
  # here is the new piece
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(text = element_text('AvantGarde'),
          strip.text = element_text(face = 'bold',
                              hjust = 0),
          plot.title = element_text(face = 'bold'),
          plot.caption = element_text('mono',
                                      size=7))
```
# Finalizing

Figure \@ref(fig:final) is our goal.

```{r final, fig.cap="Our final product.", out.width='100%', fig.align='center', echo=TRUE}

  df_long %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x=age_class, y=value)) + 
    geom_col(colour="black", width=1) + 
    aes(fill = as.factor(variable)) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("seagreen", "darkcyan", "firebrick")) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent,
                       breaks = c(seq(0, .3, .1))) +
    labs(title = "China's elderly are hardest hit by Covid-19",
           subtitle = "Age distribution of the Chinese population and of the reported\nCovid-19 cases and deaths in Hubei, China.",
           caption = "Data: Riou et al. (2020). https://github.com/jriou/covid_adjusted_cfr",
           x = "", # some would argue removing this as well
           y = "") +
    facet_wrap(~variable) + 
    coord_flip() +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(text = element_text('AvantGarde'),
          strip.text = element_text(face = 'bold',
                              hjust = 0),
          plot.title = element_text(face = 'bold'),
          plot.caption = element_text('mono',
                                      size=7),
          legend.position = "none")
```
