This is the main page. To set up the site I just ran the following:

```
library(distill)
create_website(dir = "my-website", title = "My Website")
```

It created the `my-website` directory and the initial files. Hit `knit` to see what it looks like.

Now open the `about.Rmd` file. It lives in the `my-website` directory. Find it in the files tab.
