```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

Here's a sample about page. Let's add the `{plotly}` figure from the slide deck.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
  library(tidyverse)
  library(plotly)
  p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + geom_point()
  ggplotly(p)
```

Now open the `_site.yml` file. We'll use this file to tell R how to layout the site.
