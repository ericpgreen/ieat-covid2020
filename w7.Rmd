We're in the age of big data, and text mining has never been more popular or easier to do, especially in R. Whether you are a qualitative researcher looking to automate more of your workflow or a quant seeking to pull insights from a corpus of messages, text mining is a skill you need. In this session I'll introduce you to text mining in R with `{tidytext}`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("img/wk07-plots.png")
```
