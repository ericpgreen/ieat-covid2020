	Abstract = {Objective: 
To investigate the patterns of disclosure and perceptions of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status in a group of HIV-infected elementary school---age children.Design:
A survey.Setting:
A referred care university hospital center.Patients:
All HIV-infected children born before August 31, 1985, and scheduled for ambulatory follow-up between 1984 and 1993 were eligible for the study. A total of 35 HIV-infected (21 asymptomatic and 14 symptomatic) elementary school---age children (aged 5-10 years) were examined between 1990 and 1993.Main Outcome Measures:
Semistructured qualitative interviews were used, 1 with the children and 1 with their parents or caregivers. In addition, 3 drawings per child were also analyzed.Results:
Partial disclosure was observed in 14 (40\%) of the children, and full disclosure of the diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome was given to 6 (17\%) of the children. Secrecy regarding serostatus was the strategy used by 15 (43\%) of the parents or caregivers involving either complete nondisclosure (n=8) or deception by means of attributing the symptoms to another condition, medical or other (n=7). Perceived health status and clinical status differed for 11 (31\%) of the children. Eight children did not identify any illness causality, and most of the others gave prelogical or concrete-logical explanations. Few children were aware of their parent's infection or disease.Conclusion:
Human immunodeficiency virus---infected elementary school---age children were exposed to various disclosure patterns regarding their HIV infection or disease, and most children (26/35 [74\%]) reported stressful experiences due to HIV regardless of the disclosure patterns.Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 1997;151:978-985},

@article{pinzon:2013,
	Abstract = {Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 1996, HIV-infected children often survive beyond adolescence. To assess worldwide trends in disclosure since ART was introduced, we reviewed articles that refer to disclosure of their status to HIV-infected children, and which described patient, health care provider and/or caregiver opinions about disclosure and/or reported the proportion of children who knew their diagnosis. Most studies (17 [55\%]) were performed in low- or middle-income (LMI) countries. In the 21 articles that included information on whether the children knew their status, the proportion who knew ranged from 1.2 to 75.0\% and was lower in LMI (median = 20.4\%) than industrialized countries (43\%; p = 0.04). LMI country study participants who knew their status tended to have learned it at older ages (median = 9.6 years) than industrialized country participants (median = 8.3 years; p = 0.09). The most commonly reported anticipated risks (i.e. emotional trauma to child and child divulging status to others) and benefits (i.e. improved ART adherence) of disclosure did not vary by the country's economic development. Only one article described and evaluated a disclosure process. Despite recommendations, most HIV-infected children worldwide do not know their status. Disclosure strategies addressing caregiver concerns are urgently needed.},

	Abstract = {The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly encourages the disclosure of HIV status to school-age children and further recommends that adolescents know their HIV status. Limited information exists on the impact of disclosure. We designed and implemented a disclosure model hypothesized to be associated with healthy psychological adjustment and improved medication adherence. We report the model's design and implementation and results of a quasi-experimental study of the disclosure's effects on health care professionals (n = 16), caregivers (n = 39), and HIV-infected youth (n = 40) in Puerto Rico. Information was collected from youth, caregivers, and professionals by semistructured interviews and questionnaires. Most youth (70\%) had feelings of normalcy 6 months post-disclosure, and most also improved their adherence to therapy after disclosure as reported by both patients (58\%) and caregivers (59\%). Eighty-five percent of youth and 97\% of caregivers considered disclosure a positive event for themselves and their families. Fewer health care professionals reported feelings of fear, discomfort, and insecurity after protocol participation.},

@article{jemmott:2013,
	Abstract = {When children know their HIV serostatus, they are more likely to cooperate with steps to manage their health and the risk of transmitting HIV to others. Mounting evidence indicates that caregivers often do not disclose to HIV-positive children that the children are living with HIV, but little is known about the modifiable determinants of pediatric HIV disclosure. The present study examined theory-of-planned-behavior predictors of the intention to disclose to children their HIV diagnosis. The participants were 100 caregivers of HIV-positive children in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Proportional-odds logistic regression analysis revealed that normative support for disclosure and caregiver-child communication predicted the intention to disclose, whereas behavioral beliefs regarding the consequences of disclosing and self-efficacy to disclose did not. The results suggest that interventions to increase pediatric HIV disclosure in South Africa should help caregivers enlist support for disclosure among important referents and improve communication with their HIV-infected children.},

	Abstract = {As the number of treatment-managed cases of pediatric Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) increases, the issue of disclosure has
become increasingly important. In this article, we evaluate factors
associated with disclosure in Rwanda among HIV-positive children of 7
to 15 years. A 2008 survey in Rwanda was conducted to determine these
factors. Participants in the study included 1,034 children on HAART and
in the pre-HAART phase; among them 65\% knew their HIV status, and 35\%
were unaware. The child's age was positively associated with
awareness of HIV status. Children with illiterate parents were two
times (aOR: 2.2; 95\% CI: 1.4-3.6) more likely to be disclosed than
children with high school educated parents. Children who engaged in
dialogue with their parents or other family members were 15 times and
four times, respectively, (aOR: 15.2, 95\% CI: 9.4- 24.7 and aOR: 4.1,
95\% CI: 2.4-6.9) more likely to be disclosed than those who did not.
Findings offer ways for Rwanda to improve its approach to disclosure
issues, counseling and psychosocial support for HIV-positive children.},

@article{nichols:2016,
	Abstract = {Pediatric HIV remains a significant global health dilemma, especially in resource-constrained nations. As access to ART increases around the world, areas of concern in pediatric HIV treatment include age-appropriate disclosure of HIV status to children and development of adherence habits over time. This review was conducted to synthesize quantitative associations reported between disclosure and adherence among children living with HIV in resource-limited settings. An electronic database search of PubMed, MEDLINE and Cochrane returned 1348 results after removal of duplicates, 14 of which were found to meet inclusion criteria. Review of these reports showed conflicting results regarding the impact of disclosure on adherence, with 5 showing no association, 4 showing a negative impact of disclosure on adherence, and 5 showing positive benefits of disclosure for adherence habits. Thus, there was no clear consensus on the effect, if any, that disclosure has on medication adherence. Longitudinal, prospective research needs to be conducted to evaluate further impacts that disclosure may have on adherence habits over time, and interventions must be structured to link the two processes together in order to maximize health benefit to the child or adolescent.},
