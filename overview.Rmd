Like many learners in the US (and around the world), Duke students left for Spring Break and were told not to come back. Figuring there is only so much Netflix a person can watch if you do not have small children (with children there is no practical upper bound), I decided to tune up an old workshop called "I Eat Data Science for Breakfast" and offer it via Zoom. 

I'm planning to teach the tidyverse and possibly tidymodels over 7-10 weeks. If you've had your fill of COVID-19 plots, this is not the workshop for you. I think the best way to teach students about R and data science by starting with plotting, and as it turns out, the average person is consuming 403 COVID-19 plots per day. At dinner tables all over this land, people are asking, "But shouldn't these plots be per capita?", and saying things like, "I think small multiples are a much more effective approach." Lots of data are being shared, so we'll plot our way to a better understanding of data wrangling and some modeling.

# Format and Access Instructions

I'll host a live session every Friday at 9am ET, starting Friday April 3. We'll record each session, but for the first few weeks I'll offer a repeat live session the following Wednesday at 9am ET. My plan is to use break out rooms at various points throughout the session to make sure everyone is caught up.

For Duke-affiliated learners joining the live sessions, I'll invite you to create a free account with RStudio Cloud. All you'll need to participate is a computer, an internet connection, and an internet browser. When you login to my RStudio cloud workspace, you'll be able to open that week's workshop materials and follow along in the browser. If you have not received an email from me, you are not on my list. Please contact me to get access.

For everyone else, I'll be updating this site with the slide decks, videos, and code files. There might be a lag of a few days.
